- 👋 Hi, I’m @Noxis986
- 👀 I’m interested in financial markets theory and computer science, especially, in numerical simulations and data science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning numerical methods due to the Master in Industrial Mathematics (M2i-UVigo) I am currently studying. Furthermore, the 
			'Google IT Automation with Python' specialization caught my eye and I have started it to improve my python skills, and that is the very reason why 
			I started using Github.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on real data science projects, simulations in most areas, including financial simulations, and excited to tip my toe in some
		  automation project.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can reach me in my Linkedin profile, feel free to send a message whatever the purpouse! I'm looking forward to making contacts
			and collaborating in the areas described earlier.
